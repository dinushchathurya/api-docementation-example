### Naming convention

You should choose a consistent naming schema, which makes it easier to understand what is defined and included.

E.g. with `@apiUse LoginParam`, `@apiUse LoginError`, `@apiUse LoginSuccess` you see that parameter-, errors- and
success-fields are classified with the suffix `Param`, `Error` and `Success`.
